# autoindex

Silly little nginx autoindex clone.

![Preview](https://github.com/mtimkovich/autoindex/blob/main/preview.png)

## Features

My goal was to create a file server like nginx's autoindex but add some additional features like file path breadcrumbing and additional sorting features. But at the same time I wanted to keep the simple display of nginx's UI.

## Roadmap

- [x] List filenames, sizes, and modTime
- [x] Create server, output to html
- [x] File path links
- [x] Sort directories first
- [x] File path breadcrumb
- [ ] Mobile display
- [ ] Sort by name, modTime, or size (JavaScript)
